***Version Control:***

**Keeps track of every change made to files in a project.
Allows reverting to previous versions if needed.**

***Branching and Merging:***

**Developers can work on separate branches for new features or bug fixes.
Changes can be merged into the main branch after review.**

***Distributed System:***

**Every developer has a complete copy of the project repository.
Enables offline work and enhances collaboration.***

***Efficient Collaboration:***

**Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Git tracks who made which changes and when.**

## 3. Common Git Terminology
